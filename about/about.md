## About Recumbent Dog:

I selected the name in December 2024 after a visit to the Brooklyn Museum. The name is from a small 6th century Chinese earthenware sculpture of a dog laying down. I looked at it and I thought of my dog and how much I wanted her and everything I love immortalized. I read the name and thought of “Cellar Door,” the words just sounded lovely together: Recumbent Dog.

Recumbent Dog is not a brand. It's maybe kind of a blog? This website exists because I wanted a place where the things I’m thinking about can be shared without anyone paying with money or data or advertisements to engage with them. I have some ideas or hopes or dreams of all that could live here, and we’ll see together how that plays out.

Recumbent Dog is for appreciators of the spiritual and mundane, especially who see them as an often overlapping venn diagram. An early moodboard lists: the sound of windshield wipers and gravel under tires, practicing headlessness, off-white t-shirts, natural fibers, mono case BOTH WAYS, lampshades askew. I’m always adding to it.

“I” am Racquel Cable. I hold a BFA in Creative Writing with a minor in Illustration from Columbia College Chicago.

I live in Bushwick with my spotted dog, Maude.
