## About Recumbent Dog

I selected the name in December 2024 after a visit to the Brooklyn Museum. The name is from a small 6th century Chinese earthenware sculpture of a dog laying down. I looked at it and I thought of my dog and how much I wanted her and everything I love immortalized. I read the name and thought of “Cellar Door,” the words just sounded lovely together. There's seems a joke about an "old dog" and "new tricks" that I've yet to make.

Recumbent Dog is not a brand. It's probably a blog. This website exists because I wanted a place where the things I want to share can be accessed without money or advertisements or algorithms or whatever.

Free association mood board in my notes app looks like:

off-white t-shirts  
natural fibers  
mono case BOTH WAYS  
lampshades askew
