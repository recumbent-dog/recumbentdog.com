<h2>About Recumbent Dog</h2>
<p>I selected the name in December 2024 after a visit to the Brooklyn Museum. The name is from a small 6th century Chinese earthenware sculpture of a dog laying down. I looked at it and I thought of my dog and how much I wanted her and everything I love immortalized. I read the name and thought of “Cellar Door,” the words just sounded lovely together. There's seems a joke about an &quot;old dog&quot; and &quot;new tricks&quot; that I've yet to make.</p>
<p>Recumbent Dog is not a brand. It's probably a blog. This website exists because I wanted a place where the things I want to share can be accessed without money or advertisements or algorithms or whatever.</p>
<p>Free association mood board in my notes app looks like:<br />

the sound of windshield wipers and gravel under tires<br />
practicing headlessness<br />
off-white t-shirts<br />
natural fibers<br />
mono case BOTH WAYS<br />
lampshades askew</p>
