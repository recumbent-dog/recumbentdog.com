<h2>About Recumbent Dog</h2>
<p>I selected the name in December 2024 after a visit to the Brooklyn Museum. The name is from a small 6th century Chinese earthenware sculpture of a dog laying down. I looked at it and I thought of my dog and how much I wanted her and everything I love immortalized. I read the name and thought of “Cellar Door,” the words just sounded lovely together.</p>
<p>Recumbent Dog might be enjoyed by appreciators of the spiritual and mundane, especially those who see them as an often overlapping venn diagram. Free association mood board in my notes app lists: the sound of windshield wipers and gravel under tires, practicing headlessness, off-white t-shirts, natural fibers, mono case BOTH WAYS, lampshades askew. I’m always adding to it.</p>
<p>Recumbent Dog is not a brand. It's maybe kind of a blog? This website exists because I wanted a place where the things I want to share can be accessed without money or advertisements or algorithms or whatever.</p>
<p>“I” am Racquel Cable. I like to listen to music, read, go to the movies, walk my dog, cook dinner, watercolor, and study yoga. Some things I might put on by &quot;business&quot; card: retired from cool, professional enthusiast, living room DJ. I live in Bushwick with my spotted dog, Maude.</p>
