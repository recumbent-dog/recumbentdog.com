<h2>About Recumbent Dog:</h2>
<p>I selected the name in December 2024 after a visit to the Brooklyn Museum. The name is from a small 6th century Chinese earthenware sculpture of a dog laying down. I don’t know, I looked at it and I thought of my dog and how much I wanted her and everything I love immortalized. I read the name and thought of “Cellar Door,” the words just sounded lovely together: Recumbent Dog.</p>
<p>This website exists because I wanted a place where the things I’m thinking about can be shared without anyone paying with money or data or advertisements to engage with them. I have some ideas or hopes or dreams of all that could live here, and we’ll see together how that plays out.</p>
<p>Recumbent Dog is not a blog or a brand. Recumbent Dog is for appreciators of the spiritual and mundane, especially who see them as an often overlapping venn diagram. An early moodboard lists: the sound of windshield wipers and gravel under tires, practicing headlessness, off-white t-shirts, natural fibers, mono case BOTH WAYS, lampshades askew. I’m always adding to it.</p>
<p>“I” am Racquel Cable. I hold a BFA in Creative Writing with a minor in Illustration from Columbia College Chicago. I’ve worked in printmaking, film production, coffee, casual dining, retail, and tech. Some quippy ways I’ve described myself include: retired from cool, professional enthusiast, and living room DJ. I live in Bushwick with my spotted dog, Maude.</p>
<p>I’d love to collaborate with you on a project or event, create a guest mix for your radio station, or simply hear what’s on your mind.</p>
